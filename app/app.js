Its got enough juice that youll never have to worry about your phone charge, but not enough that youre tempted to stream all of Grays Anatomy when you could be sitting around the campfire. Its big enough to include some extras, like a flashlight (handy) and an AC outlet, which was a feature I didnt even realize Id want until I made it to camp. But even with all that its still small enough that you wont have to account for its size when fitting all your gear into your car.",
